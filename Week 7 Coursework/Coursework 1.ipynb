    "    <li> To test your file, you should consider running it in a terminal.  A terminal can be opened by clicking the <samp>Terminal</samp> tile in the <samp>Launcher</samp> window.  If you are in the same directory as your <samp>grids.py</samp> file, this file can be run with the instruction <code>python grids.py</code> (or <code>python -i grids.py</code>, if you wish to open an interactive console after execution).</li><br>\n",
    "    <li> Do not worry if you are struggling to write a method.  It may be better to test your code outside of the <samp>Grid</samp> class first, before folding it into the class as a new method.  For example, you could test any method that affects the <samp>_occupancies</samp> attribute by applying your code to some list that <em>represents</em> <samp>_occupancies</samp>, rather than wasting time re-running code and initialising new instances every few minutes. </li><br>\n",
    "    <li> As stated above, some of the marks for this coursework are given on the basis of documentation.  Please ensure that your code is fully documented before submission.  It may be worth doing this last however, just in case you decide to change any of the functionality of the code before the final draft. </li>\n",
